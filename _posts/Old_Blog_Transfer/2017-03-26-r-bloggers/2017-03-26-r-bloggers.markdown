I'm very pleased to announce that my posts about R will now be cross-posted to [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/){:target="_blank"}!  
  
I love the site, and the cool personal projects that people do with R and then share with the community. Glad to be a part of the community, and hope that R-enthusiasts will enjoy my fun little projects as much as I do.
