As with the [analysis of "Magna Carta"]{{ site.baseurl }}({% link _posts/Old_Blog_Transfer/2014-05-05-jay-z-magna-carta-part-2/2014-05-05-jay-z-magna-carta-part-2.markdown %} ){:target="_blank"}, I made a big comparison cloud with the text of "Yeezus." This visualization takes all of the words extracted by the text analysis, and displays them according to song. It's a big chart, but that's necessary to show everything clearly. Very interesting- I think it looks cool, too. Color palette generated with [I Want Hue](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/){:target="_blank"}.
